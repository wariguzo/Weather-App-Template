## Description

You will be building a React appliction similar to the demo below. This application will enhance your existing knowledge of the React basics (components, JSX, props, event handling, using forms, making API calls, basic hooks) and allow you to practice with React best practices.
<br>
Below you will see a demo of the Weather Application that will load data from the OpenWeatherAPI based on a location of choice. The application will display the weather for the current day.

## Demo

** Your project does not need to look 100% like the images below, but it is encouraged to aim for it**

## Important Git/GitHub Expectations:

- [ ] Set up a GitHub repository for your group, after the repository is set up add [branch protections](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) that require at least one PR approval before merging into `main`
- [ ] All your work should be done within branches, and code only should be moved to `main` after a teammate has approved a pull request. As you wrk, do regular adds/commits to give yourself multiple "save points" just in case something goes wrong.
- [ ] <strong>It is very important that you create a new branch off of the updated `main` branch every time you start a new feature. This branch should be used to complete the functionality associated with that branch and should be named accordingly</strong> Once the feature/functionality in this branch is finished, a PR can be made to merge the branch into `main`, and a new branch can be created for your next task. <strong>This process is crucial to minimize mere conflicts and mimicking the workfow you'll use once you join a development team.</strong>
- [ ] Use clear, descriptive, and professional commit messages. (This will make things easier if you ever have to revert to a prior commit, and it looks great to potential employers!)
- [ ] Reference the [Git Collaboration Workflow Document](https://github.com/scullenDev/git-collaboration-workflow) for a list of Git best practices!

## Recommended APIs

Geolocator: to get the coordinates and pass your latitude and longitude to get the weather of your location.

<br>
OpenWeatherAPI: to get the weather based on coordinates and display the data to the user

[OpenWeatherAPI Link](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Important Notes on APIs:

Begin searching a weather API ([OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) is an option)

<strong>Notes on the OpenWeather API:</strong>

If you choose to use the OpenWeather API, you will discover quickly that the API's free tier limits you to 1000 requests per day. This should be more than enough, but if the limit is hit, then the cooldown period of each call is 24 hours.

When using OpenWeather API, the main endpoint is: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=NewYork&appid=${APIKEY}`, where APIKEY is an environment variable.

<strong>Choosing an API:</strong>

- Make sure the API is free or has a free tier.
- <strong>Make sure the API allows LOTS of free requests.</strong>
- Make sure the API either requires no authentication or simple authentication, else it may not be workable in a front-end only app.
- Make sure the API returns data in JSON format.
- Make sure the API has good documentation.
- <strong>Make sure that the API outputs the data your app needs.</strong>

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Since your application will be front-end only (with no back-end server), there are some APIs that will not work for you due to a lack of CORS permissions on the API server. Learn more about CORS below and take a look at one potential workaround:

- [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
- [What are CORS proxies, and when are they safe?](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/cors-proxies/)
- [CORS Anywhere](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) - this is one of those less-than-ideal and somewhat risky resource, but for a simple project like this one with no secure data being transmitted, it's okay in a pinch.

## Getting Started
The first thing you will want to do is create a fork from this GitHub Repository

Here are the steps on how to fork a GitHub Repository:
<br>
1. To fork a repo, in the top right corner of the GitHub Repository you can either:
```
Click where it says "Fork", and then on the drop down click "Create a new fork
```
![How to Fork](readme_assets/Fork_Example.png)
Or
<br>
```
Click where it says "Use this template" and then on the drop down click "Create a new repository"
```
![How to use Template](readme_assets/Template_Example.png)
<br>
2. After you fork the repository, you will need to clone your forked repository to your computer. To do that click the green button where it says "<>Code" and then copy over the link.
![](readme_assets/Clone_Example.png)
<br>
3. After you copy the link, open a terminal and run the command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/<github username goes here>/<repository name goes here>.git
```
Now that you forked this repository and then cloned it to your computer here are some other ways to get started:
- [ ] Install depedencies, after you open your project, open your terminal and run the command `npm install`, this will install all you dependencies needed, you should see a `node_modules` folder.
- [ ] Run Application, after you install you dependencies, you need to run your application, to do so run this command in your terminal: `npm run dev`, this will run your application and serve it to localhost.
- [ ] Take time to read through the [core requirements](#requirements) below, and think through what components your app will need, what data you'll need to access, what you might store in state, etc.
- [ ] Consider using [Trello](https://trello.com/) to create a project board to track tasks, priorities and deadlines, and for visibility into project progress and remaining priorities. [See here](https://trello.com/b/WjhFXOdJ/demo-project-board) for an example of how one might be organized.
- [ ] Dig into the React or JavaScript documentation if you get stuck!
- [ ] When you run into a bug or other unexpected behavior, use your debugging tools wisely: read error messages critically, set breakpoints, use `console.log()` and watch variables, use your Google Fu, etc.
- [ ] Challenge yourself to use ES6 syntax whenever possible: arrow functions, destructuring, the spread operator, object property value shorthand, template literals, etc

## Requirements

- [ ] <strong>No code should be merged into `main` until all console and terminal errors and warnings are corrected</strong>
- [ ] Upon initial render, your app should load a one-day weather details for the default location of your choice.
- [ ] Your app should have a search bar that allows a user to specify a new location to search in. After user search, the app should render weather forecast data for the new location.
- [ ] The user of your app should be able to enter either a city/state, a zip code, an address, or a landmark for their search term. If your weather API relies on a lat/lon for search, use a geocoder to convert the human-friendly search into location coordinates.
- [ ] Each component's props should be destructured for component readibility.
- [ ] Pull data from your external APIs using `axios` or `fetch`
- [ ] Hide any API keys using a `.env.local` or `.env` file
- [ ] Your app should have multiple components. Use props to pass data from parent components into child components to allow customization of the child components. (Sometimes it's easiest to start with one or two big components, and to break code out into smaller, more specific components after the core functionality is in place.)
- [ ] Make your code as DRY (<strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself) as possible!

## Bonuses

- [ ] Use a React-speciic CSS framework like reactstrap or React Materialize to jumpstart your styling, and to ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Disable the search button until the user has entered a search value.
- [ ] Install React Router and route users to a separate page to view forecast details.
- [ ] Have your app auto-detect a user's location on render (if that feature is enabled on the user's end) and use this location to render the initial weather forecast.
- [ ] Consider implementing autocomplete functionality on your location search field. (Use an autocomplete API for this.)
- [ ] Deploy your application and share the url with the team so we can all try it!
- [ ] Write a detailed README.md file using best practices: [README Template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
- [ ] Look into using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/install) as a tool for build, standardizing, and documenting your React components in isolation

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`
Runs ESLint to analyze your code for potential errors and enforce coding standards. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

### `npm run build`
Builds the application for production. This command compiles your React application into static files for deployment. The output is stored in the `dist` directory.

### `npm run serve`
Serves the production build of your application locally. This is useful for testing the production build on your local machine. Typically, this command uses a tool like `serve` to serve the static files. You also need to run `npm run build` before running this command.# The-Weather-App
